      <p class="aboutMe">
        Hi, I’m Caroline. Thanks for stopping by. I’m a mixed-media artist, self taught, from Bonnie Scotland. I have a love for
        pencil, charcoal and watercolour art and enjoy a bit of a mash up of all
        these mediums. I also like to tinker with a little bit of tech to edit
        my work, particularly pro-create and photoshop. <br /><br />I have an
        obsession with drawing people and flowers and take influence and
        inspiration from many artists, past and present, including Jack
        Vettriano, Edward Hopper, Ron Lawson, Polina Bright and the wonderful
        Matylda Konecka. <br /><br />My passion for art has developed through
        the years and was the one thing I really enjoyed at school. I also had a
        dad who was very creative, with lots of hobbies including photography,
        printmaking, jewellery design, to name but a few. I’d like to share some
        of my work with you, Enjoy!
